# Unit-Testing
## How To Build/Run/Compile<br>
 1. Create a sample project in the visual studio for Asp.Net core web application by using c#.<br>
 2. Create a models folder and add class to that folder.<br>
 3. Add GUI for the pages.<br>
 4. Create a new project in the solution for the unit testing.<br>
 5. Add a new project for the unit testing. 
 6. Configure the new project into MSTest Test Project(.Net Core) and create.<br>
 7. Now we have 2 projects in the solution explorer.<br>
 8. Add reference to the code under test.<br>
 9. Create the unit test code.<br>
10. Open the test and select Test Explorer.<br>
11. Start running the unit test.<br>
12. Test reuslts are displayed if any errors debugg the code and fix bugs. <br>
13. Then re run the unit test.<br>
14. If everything works then the test case is passed.<br>


## Test Case (about sample Project)<br>
The purpose of the project is to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. When we build a project, we'll include a temperature class and the desired methods for calculating various temperatures. We need to create a new unit unit testing project and add a reference the project in the dependencies. Then we must add a particular code from the models to the test file and run the test files using the test explorer.
